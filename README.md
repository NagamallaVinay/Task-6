# Task-6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

# Objective: Understand and implement KNN for classification problems.
# Tools:  Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

# Step by step Procedure :
       1.Choose a classification dataset and normalize features.
       2.Use KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.
       3.Experiment with different values of K.
       4.Evaluate model using accuracy, confusion matrix.
       5.Visualize decision boundaries.
